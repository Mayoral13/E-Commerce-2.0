A USER CAN LIST AN ITEM WITH THE FOLLOWING ARGUMENTS
{

BOTH CAN BE SWAPPED FOR ONE ANOTHER ON THE CONTRACT 
ALSO NOTE FOR EVERY BUYING OF EITHER TOKEN OR ETHER A 10% FEE IS CHARGED 
AND GIVEN TO THE CONTRACT 

*NOTHING IN LIFE IS FREE*

UPON LISTING THE ITEM USERS CAN SEARCH THE ITEM LISTED WITH ITS ID
BUT CONFUSION MAY ARISE WHEN THE ITEMS GET TO MANY TO KEEP TRACK OF ID NUMBER

SO A FUNCTION HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE TO RETURN THE ID NUMBER OF ITEMS LISTED BY USERS
SO IF AN ITEM WAS LISTED AT ID 478
TO GET THE ITEM THE USER JUST NEEDS THE ADDRESS OF THE USER THAT LISTED IT AND SEARCH IT WITH THE FUNCTION
AN ARRAY OF ID'S WILL BE RETURNED
*TODO* A MORE CONVINIENT APPROACH BE THOUGHT OF*TODO*
ALSO WHEN BUYING ITEM WITH EITHER TOKEN OR ETH NO FEE IS CHARGED AND THE AMOUNT IS SENT DIRECTLY TO THE LISTERS
